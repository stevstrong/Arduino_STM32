This USB CDC module is based on pieces of code taken from (german site):
http://stefanfrings.de/stm32/stm32f1.html#vcpnohal
and from some of the links provided there.

Current Status:

    The implementation of the CDC driver is considerd to be complete.
	The USB driver consists of 3 C modules:
	usb.c - the USB core functions
	usb_desc.c - the CDC descriptor definitions, the CDC uses VID:PID of 1EAF:0004.
	usb_cdc.c - some CDC functions to interface the existing libmaple core.
	The driver is simple and easily understandable, and is based partially on the existing libmaple core functions.


TODO:

	- Write custom application examples based on this (MSC, HID)
